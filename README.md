# 📘 Iris Dataset Analysis – Beginner Project

This project walks through basic data science tasks using the classic **Iris dataset**. It is divided into three main tasks and is perfect for beginners who want to learn how to load, analyze, and visualize data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

---

## ✅ Task 1: Data Loading and Exploration

In this task, we:
- Loaded the Iris dataset using `pandas` and `sklearn`.
- Viewed the first few rows using `.head()`.
- Checked for missing values and data types.
- Cleaned the dataset (although the Iris dataset had no missing values).

🔧 **Tools used**:  
`pandas`, `sklearn.datasets`, basic Python functions.

---

## 📊 Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

In this task, we:
- Computed basic statistics using `.describe()`, `.median()`, and `.std()`.
- Grouped data by the species and calculated the average measurements for each group.
- Identified interesting insights about the differences between flower species.

📌 **Findings**:
- Setosa has the smallest petals.
- Virginica has the largest petals.
- Petal length is a useful feature for distinguishing species.

## 📈 Task 3: Data Visualization

In this task, we created the following visualizations:
1. **Line Chart** – Simulated time series of Sepal Length.
2. **Bar Chart** – Average Petal Length by Species.
3. **Histogram** – Distribution of Sepal Width.
4. **Scatter Plot** – Relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length.

🖼️ **Libraries used**:  
`matplotlib`, `seaborn`

Each chart includes clear titles, axis labels, and legends to make them easy to understand.
